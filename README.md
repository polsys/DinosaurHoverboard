# Dinosaur Hoverboard

This is my entry to [Ludum Dare 36](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/08/24/welcome-to-ludum-dare-36/) jam.

I had to learn Java for an assignment. While the syntax is not too hard for a C# programmer, I wanted to build a tiny project. The timing was perfect for participating in my first Ludum Dare!

(*cough* how fitting that the theme was Ancient Technology *cough cough*)


## "Story"

The giant meteorite is just hours away from colliding into Earth and wiping the dinosaur society. A wormhole to safety is ready, but the meteorite deniers (they weren't that advanced...) have halted the operation.

Luckily, you happen to have a hoverboard. Dodge your way to the portal and save your civilization!


## About the project

* This game uses [libgdx](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).
* The code is obviously not production quality.
* All source code and assets are bundled in this repo, including original Photoshop files. They were all written/drawn by me.
* I still have no idea about the build system: don't ask me how to open or build the project! It involves Gradle.
